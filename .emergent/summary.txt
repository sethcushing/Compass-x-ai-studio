<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a modern, light-themed, informational landing page named Emergent Enterprise Architecture Landing Page (later renamed to Compass X AI Studio). The page's objective is to explain how Emergent operates within a client’s enterprise ecosystem. It must be a non-interactive marketing and architecture visualization page with no sign-ups, forms, or CTAs.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Theme:** Light, modern, minimalistic, with a professional architecture-diagram style.
- **Color Palette:** Initially primary orange accent, later changed to a beachy sky-blue.
- **UI Style:** Rounded cards, thin dividers, subtle shadows, line icons only.
- **Typography:** Specific hierarchy for titles, subtitles, and body copy. Font later changed to Lato.
- **Page Structure (7 sections in order):**
    1.  Header
    2.  Delivery Walkthrough Flow
    3.  Enhancement Lifecycle
    4.  Architecture Layers Diagram
    5.  Release Pipeline
    6.  Governance Model
    7.  Closing Statement
- **Additional Section:** A Delivery Team section was added later based on user request.
- **Functionality:** All diagram components must be data-driven from an internal JSON/JS config. The page should be responsive. Several sections were later updated to be interactive with expandable/collapsible details.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A complete, single-page informational website built with React and TailwindCSS. All content is driven by a local mock data file (). The backend (FastAPI) exists but is not used by the frontend. The application has been styled according to user feedback, featuring a beachy blue color scheme, Lato font, and the name Compass X AI Studio. Several sections are interactive, using accordions and clickable panels to reveal more detailed information. Docker files and configurations for deployment have been created and debugged for deployment on a platform like Koyeb.

- **Deployment Preparation & Debugging:**
    - Created a production-ready multi-stage , along with  and  configurations.
    - Resolved a Docker build failure by removing the dependency on .
    - Resolved a Koyeb deployment failure by changing the application's listening port from 8080 to 8000.
    - Fixed a Python dependency installation error by removing the private  package from .
- **UI/UX Fixes:**
    - Corrected the highlighting logic in the Governance section.
    - Fixed alignment issues in the Delivery Team section.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None. All issues raised by the user during the session have been addressed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS,  for icons. The UI is data-driven, with all page content and structure defined in .
- **Backend:** FastAPI. The backend server exists from the template but is not integrated with the frontend for this informational site.
- **Deployment:** A container-based approach using Docker, with Nginx serving the static React build and Supervisor managing the processes.

**key DB schema**
- The application is purely informational and does not interact with a database. A schema for  exists in  but is unused.

**changes in tech stack**
- No changes were made to the core technologies. The application remains a React/FastAPI project, though only the React part is functionally utilized.

**All files of reference**
- : This file is critical as it contains all the text, data, and structure for the entire landing page. Any content change will likely involve editing this file.
- : This directory contains the individual React components for each section of the page.
- : The root component that assembles the page from the section components.
- : Defines the production build and deployment environment for the application.
- : Configured to serve the React app and proxy requests, listening on port 8000.
- : Manages the Nginx and backend processes within the container.
-  & : Define the custom theme (colors, fonts).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The application is a **frontend-only informational page**. The backend is not used. All content is managed via the  file.
- The user is highly focused on visual design and UX. Be prepared for specific feedback on spacing, alignment, colors, and interactivity.
- The deployment environment is Dockerized, using Nginx to serve the React build on port **8000**. This port was changed specifically to fix a deployment issue on the Koyeb platform.
